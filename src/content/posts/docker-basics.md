# Docker Basics for Developers

Docker has revolutionized the way we develop, deploy, and run applications. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the fundamentals of Docker and containerization.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that enables developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. These containers can run consistently across different environments, from development to production.

## Key Concepts

### Containers vs Virtual Machines

Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host system's kernel but isolate the application processes. This makes them more efficient and faster to start.

### Images and Containers

- **Images**: Read-only templates used to create containers
- **Containers**: Running instances of images

## Getting Started

To begin with Docker, you'll need to install Docker Desktop on your machine. Once installed, you can start building and running containers.

## Common Docker Commands

- `docker build`: Build an image from a Dockerfile
- `docker run`: Run a container from an image
- `docker ps`: List running containers
- `docker images`: List available images

## Conclusion

Docker simplifies the process of managing application dependencies and environments, making development more efficient and deployments more reliable.
